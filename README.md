# Keypad
My first Unity assignment in my OOP class for C#

The keypad starts in a locked state and gives you an infinite amount of tries to unlock it using a 9-number pad. When the code is input incorrectly, the UI flashes red and resets the combination previously entered. When the user correctly guesses the code, the UI flashes green and you are no longer able to use the unlock button.
